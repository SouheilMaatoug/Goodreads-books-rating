## Book Review Data Linear Regression Model Analysis_V2

### Introduction
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing book review data and build a linear regression model to predict the average rating of books based on several features.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this model, named "book_analysis_output," was provided and updated by my colleague. It includes the following features: title, authors, average rating, ratings count, text reviews count, number of pages, publication year, and publication month.
The updated details:some minor changes:Two dates are in wrong format so it has been removed,he has adapted the year column and month column so they are usable, some outliers are removed

### Data Analysis
**Data Cleaning:** The dataset was loaded and any leading spaces in column names were removed.

**Data Visualization:** Various visualizations were created to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
- `sns.pairplot`: Scatter plots of variables against each other, helping visualize relationships.
- `sns.heatmap`: A correlation heatmap, showing correlation coefficients between variables. Brighter colors indicate stronger correlations.

**Linear Regression:**
- **Features:** The model was trained using 'ratings_count', 'text_reviews_count', and 'num_pages' as independent variables (X), and 'average_rating' as the target variable (y).
- **Training and Testing:** Data was split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- **Model Training:** Linear Regression model was initialized and fitted on the training data.
- **Predictions:** Predictions were made on the test data using the trained model.

### Results
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.07416325833412434
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.21242995946499926
- **R-squared (R2) Score:** 0.03428519568010524
- **Cross-Validation Scores:** [0.04932286 0.01271813 0.02139295 0.03089471 0.02067053]
- **Average CV Score:** 0.026999834867191996

**Interpretation:**
- **MSE:** On average, the squared difference between predicted and actual average ratings is 0.074, indicating improved accuracy.
- **MAE:** The predicted ratings are off by approximately 0.212 from actual ratings on average, showing better accuracy.
- **R2 Score:** About 3.4% of the variance in average ratings is explained by selected features, a slight improvement.
- **Cross-Validation Scores:** The model's generalization ability is consistent, with a slightly improved average score.

### Conclusion
The updated model with updated dataset version(book_analysis_output) has shown improvements in performance. However, the model's overall explanatory power remains modest. Consider exploring more sophisticated models, additional features, or alternative approaches for further enhancements.
